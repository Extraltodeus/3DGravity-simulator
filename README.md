# 3DGravity-simulator
A simple unity project that I've made for fun with Unity.

Controls are simple :

WASD for moving

space/left shift for Up/Down

Right click to release the mouse in order to use the UI on the left.

You can change the stars densities, sizes and initial speed.

You can also set the global gravity constant or even use a negative one, anchore a star, have everything only on a 2D pane, pause/unpause the physics and stop everything where it is.

Check out the repository release if you want to try it!
